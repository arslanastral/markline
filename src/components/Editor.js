> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.


1. And there are numbererd lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:

## Images

![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png)
![Stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg "The Stormtroopocat")

Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax

![Alt text][id]

With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:

[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg  "The Dojocat"

export default Editor;
